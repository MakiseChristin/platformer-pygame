This is the initial commit.

Objectives:-

1. The task is to create a game similar to the chrome dino game that appears when someone is not connected to Internet.

2. Make the background scroll when the object moves (currently the background scrolls in the right direction automatically).

3. Make the left side movement perfect.


Changes:-

1. Create the main file for the platformer, having an automatic scrolling background. 

2. Added a blue box that can move perfectly fine in both direction.

Problems:-

1. Right hand side movement is perfect but the left side movement is having issues.
